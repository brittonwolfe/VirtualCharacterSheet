# To-Do

## Refactors

- [ ] Refactor the different types of init methods in Scripting to use scopes. This means we can load a brew in one scope, run a sandbox in another, and run behaviors in yet another. This makes it *way* easier to put together the environment.

## UI Progress

- [ ] Create TUIs
- [ ] Make GUIs work

## Serialization

- [ ] Make the character serializer

## NI/O

- [ ] Write a host for networking and communicating game state, preferably RESTful.
- [ ] Write a client for connecting to the host to synchronize and communicate the game state.
