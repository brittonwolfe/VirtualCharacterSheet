# VirtualCharacterSheet
The Virtual Character Sheet is a project for better online and local TTRPG bookkeeping through robust, scriptable systems and modules, with support for things like Homebrew and importing relevant spells, items, etc. from books with minimal effort.

## About the Linux branch
While the Linux branch is still very much a work in progress, cross-platform compatibility is definitely on my roadmap, as well as web-application versions that can be hosted by the GM that add more flexibility to how the game can be played and interacted with. Additionally, developing for more platforms has been a goal of mine, and this is a great avenue to explore that.
